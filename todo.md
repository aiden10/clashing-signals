- Prevent cursors from going off screen and from entering opponent's side

- Improved visuals

- Game over screen
    - I'm already checking for game overs in game.gd

- Deckbuilding screen before the actual game

- More cards (minions and spells)

- Sounds/Music

- Figure out a way to better incorporate the theme
