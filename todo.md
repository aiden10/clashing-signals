- Prevent cursors from going off screen and from placing units on enemy side
	- the cursor should be greyed out they cannot play the unit
	- spells can be played anywhere

- Sprites for each unit and towers. These can just be basic shapes

- Figure out a way to better incorporate the theme
	Units have a line drawn from them to their target, and a line drawn to their nearest friendly tower
	The lines represent their "signals" 
	Then mixing these signals can make enemy units friendly, or switch targets
	Units which are closer to their "radio towers" have stronger signal and improved stats
    Spells:
		- Improve signal strength in an area, buffing friendly units
		- Decrease signal strength for enemy units in an area
		- "Scramble" signals, making enemies target random units
		- EMP: Temporarily sever all signals of units in an area
	Buildings:
		- AOE field that buffs units (antennas)
		- Spawner whose minions provide minor AOE buffs/debuffs
		- Jammer which severs enemy signals 
        - Backdoor: a one-way teleporter type building which allows friendly units to come out the other side. I would reflect the position across the y axis so an additional version is placed automatically

- Provide at least three viable builds + multipurpose units that could fit into multiple builds
    - Rush: cheap units
    - Defensive: mainly buildings
