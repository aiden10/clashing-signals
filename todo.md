- Prevent cursors from going off screen and from entering opponent's side

- Improved visuals

- Game over screen
	- I'm already checking for game overs in game.gd

- Deckbuilding screen before the actual game

- More cards (minions and spells)

- Sounds/Music

- Figure out a way to better incorporate the theme
	Units have a line drawn from them to their target, and a line drawn to their nearest friendly tower
	The lines represent their "signals" 
	Then mixing these signals can make enemy units friendly, or switch targets
	Units which are closer to their "radio towers" have stronger signal and improved stats
	Spells:
		- Improve signal strength in an area, buffing friendly units
		- Decrease signal strength for enemy units in an area
		- "Scramble" signals, making enemies target random units
		- EMP: Disconnect signal strength for all units in an area
	Buildings:
		- AOE field that buffs units (antennas)
		- Spawner whose minions provide minor AOE buffs/debuffs
		-
